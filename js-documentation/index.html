                <article>
                    <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It
                        is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for
                        example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of
                        its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        
                    <p>
                        JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date,
                        and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                        structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a
                        variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for
                        example:
                    </p>
        
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                            to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                            client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an
                            HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                            and page navigation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects
                            relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side
                            extensions allow an application to communicate with a database,
                            provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of
                            the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.
                        </li>

                        JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different
                        in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have
                        Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most
                        Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow
                        constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to
                        JavaScript.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
                        declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
                        number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values.
                        JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common
                        class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic
                        inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects.
                        JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative
                        requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as
                        loosely typed methods.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
                        have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to
                        be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and
                        you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and
                        function return types are not explicitly typed.

                <article>
                    You can declare a variable in three ways:
                    <p>
                        With the keyword var. For example, <code>var x = 42.</code> This syntax
                        can be used to declare both local and global variables.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By simply assigning it a value. For example, <code>x = 42.</code> This
                        always declares a global variable. It generates a strict JavaScript
                        warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With the keyword let. For example,<code> let y = 13.</code> This syntax
                        can be used to declare a block scope local variable. See Variable scope
                        below.
                    </p>
                </article>
            </section>
        
            <section class="main-section" id="global_varibales">
                <header>Global variables</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Global varibale are variable that not declare or defined inside of any function
                        Hence the sit in the global scope and Global varibale are accessible inside of a any function defined in
                        the code. And in JavasCript Global varible are just properties of the Global Object. In the browser it's
                        the Window Object. That means we can set and acees global properties using the window.variable syntax.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        Consequently, you can access global variables declared in one window or
                        frame from another window or frame by specifying the window or frame
                        name. For example, if a variable called phoneNumber is declared in a
                        document, you can refer to this variable from an iframe as
                        parent.phoneNumber.

                    <p>
                        When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
                        global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
                        current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it is
                        called a local variable, because it is available only within that
                        function.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        JavaScript before ECMAScript 2015 does not have block statement scope;
                        rather, a variable declared within a block is local to the function (or
                        global scope) that the block resides within. For example the following
                        code will log 5, because the scope of x is the function (or global
                        context) within which x is declared, not the block, which in this case
                        is an if statement.

                      console.log(x); // true

                    <p>
                        You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The
                        syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable
                        identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and
                        can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.
                    </p>
        
                    <pre><code>const PI = 3.14;</code></pre>
                    <p>
                        A constant cannot change value through assignment or be re-declared
                        while the script is running. It has to be initialized to a value.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope
                        variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to
                        represent a variable.
                    </p>
        
                    <p>
                        You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
                        variable in the same scope. For example:
                    </p>
                    <pre>
              <code
                >// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS WILL
                CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g; //statements
                }</code
              ></pre>
                    However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
                    is executed without problems.
                    <pre><code
                >const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key = "otherValue";</code

                    <p>The latest ECMAScript standard defines seven data types:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
                            <ul>

                                    null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript
                                    is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any
                                    other variant.

                                    Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are
                                    unique and immutable.
                                </li>

                    </ul>
                    Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable you
                    to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and functions
                    are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can think of
                    objects as named containers for values, and functions as procedures that
                    your application can perform.

                    <p>Sometimes we want to execute a set of code based on the result of a condition.
                        Example if we are given a number to find out whether that particular number is even or odd. In case we
                        need a condition to check if the given number is even or odd based on the result of the condition we can
                        tell. Example we are given an interger number 7
                        the task is to write a code that will determine whether tjis number is even or odd. We could write an if
                        staement
                        <pre> <code>
                  if (7 % 2 === 0) {
                    console.log("7 is Even"); // true
                  } else {
                    console.log("7 is Odd"); // false
                  }
                </code></pre><br>
        
                        The If statement check if the condition between parenthese is true
                        then execute the first set of code if not nothing will happen the control
                        continue on the next line of statement after the if block. But we can provide
                        an else block which is optinal to the if statement. The else block will execute only if the condition of
                        if statement return false. We could Even Write a chain of if...else if.. else block depending on our
                        program
                        Example: We have three person and their age [20, 30, 18] our task is to find out
                        which one of these three person is older.
        
                        let create three variable for these person and their ages;
        
        
        
                        <pre>
                <code>
                  var jimmy = 20, john = 30;
                  var mark = 18;
                  if (Jimmy > mark) {
                    if (jimmy > john) {
                      console.log("jimmy is the oldest one");
                    }
                  } else if (mark > jimmy) {
                    if (mark > john) {
                    console.log("mark is the oldest one");
                    }
                  } else if (john > jimmy){
                    if (john > mark)
                      console.log("John is the oldes one");
                  } else {
                    console.log("The might all have the same age");
                  }
                </code></pre>
        
                        Note: The scope of if and else statement is immediately the next line of code after if or else if the {}
                        is ommitted;

                <article>
                    <p>The swith statement allow us to make take an expression
                        and evaluate it with defferent cases that might match the expression .
                        If the match is found then that code for that case will execute and the control
                        will fall through all the remaing case and show their code result. To avoid This once a particular match
                        is found we might want to quit the switch statement in that case We can use the break staement after the
                        each case. Example We want to check our varible value and show a message in the console
                        <pre>
              <code>
                var str = "awesome day";
                
                swicth (str) {
                case "awesome day":
                  console.log("awesome day");
                  break;
                  case "terrible day":
                    console.log("Terrible day");
                  break;
                  default:
                    console.log("Error no matches found");
                } 
              </code></pre><br>
        
                        In this case the code will execute and will get "awesome day" in the console,
                        suppose we ignore the break statement then the code will execute and the first match will shown to
                        console and the remaining cases as well even the default option.
        
                        Note: The default case is optfinal in the switch stetement and it's just like the else statement
                        associated with the if block

                <article>
                    <p>Sometime when writting program we want to execute a code of block repeatedly
                        instead of writting each statement line by line.A simple example my be we wanna print to the console 0 -
                        100. We could write a for which is a control structure and if take three parameter, (initialization,
                        condition, increment).
                        <pre><code>
                  for (var i = 0; i &lt; 100; i++) {
                    console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2,.........,99
                  }
                </code></pre>
        
                        This loop will start with a counter i and is first set to 0.
                        Then next is be the checking of the condition if i is less than 100 and obviously it is.
                        The next step to excute is the code inside of the curly braces {}. After that next step is to increment
                        i by 1 and now i is equal to 1;
                        then next is the condition check and i is indeed less than 100, then the code in in loop will execute
                        again and again till i become 100 then the condition will check is 100 less than 100 which is false/ The
                        loop terminate and the exauction of the code continue on the next line after the for loop.
        
                        Note: Th initialization stage just happen only once

                    <p>While loop is a form of for loop but instead including the initialization stage in the loop it happen
                        outside of the loop first we must declare a loop counter the check if the condition is true if it is the
                        the body of the loop will execute and we must include the incrementation stage inside of the while loop
                        like so:
                        <pre>  <code>
                  var counter = 0;
                  
                  while (counter &lt; 100) {
                    console.log(counter); // output: 0, 1, ......., 99
                    counter++;
                  }
                  
                  </pre></code>

                <article>
                    <p>The do while loop is a deffaren't kind of loop that assure us our code defined
                        inside the do while loop will get executed at least once. Because The do while loop will execute our
                        code block then at the end check if the condition is true if it is
                        it will repeated the code inside the curly braces and check again it continue the same process as long
                        as the condition result is true. Example we wanna prompt a user for number between 1 - 20. we could
                        write
                        <pre><code>
                  var n;
                  
                  do {
                    n = Number(prompt("Enter a number between 1 - 20", ""));
                  } while(n &lt; 1 && n &gt; 20);
                </code></pre><br>
        
                        Note: The prompt(); method allow us to get input from the user and return the value the user has typed
                        in the prompt but this method return a string as a value which we must convert into number using The
                        JavaScript Number fucntion.

                    <p>Arrays are a list of data, in Javascript array can contains deffrent types of data like numbers, strings,
                        booleans, objects, functions etc.., which is not possible in the programming language like java and C++,
                        because the array strong typed language while javascript is a dynamically typed language which means
                        that Javascript compiler is able to distinguishe between a number and a string and it will do it on the
                        fly means at run time. In javascript we declare an array using [] or create a new instance of the
                        JavaScript Array Object. Syntax
                        <pre><code>

                <p>
                    In javScript Function are main building block of the language. In javascript
                    function can be treated as value, and can function can be passed o another function
                    as arguments and function can return function because all this aspect function in JavaScript are called
                    first class function. Syntax of defining a fucntion in JavaScript
                    <pre>
              <code>
                function functionName(param1, param2,...) {
                  /// some code here
                }
                
                functionName();
              </code></pre><br>
                    In the above example we can see that before defining a function we must use the function keyword folllowed
                    by the function name and set of parantheses in which we can list some parameters to transport some value
                    into our function that will be use in the function scope and treated as local variable of this function. And
                    this way of writting function is named function declaration
                </p>
                <h2>Function Expression</h2>
                <p>There another way of defining a function in javaScript and it's funtion expression
                    because it just like an expression. Syntax
                    <pre>
            <code>
                var greet = function(name) {
                return  "Hello " + name;
            }
                greet("John Doe"); // Hello John Doe
              </code>
        </pre><br>
                    When we writting a function like this we must defining it first then call it down the line not before this
                    happen because in the creation phase of varibale object that each an every execution context get, the code
                    is scanned for variables declarations and for each varibale declaration a property is created in the
                    varibale object and set to undefined. so when we are writting function expression we have to remenber that
                    we can;t call it before the code that define the function we can only call it after the code that define it.
                    Example
        
                    <pre>
              <code>
                mult(2, 2); /// TypeError: mult is not a function
                var mult = function(x, y) {
                  return x * y;

                                <p>Hoisting is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the
                                    top of their scope before code execution. Inevitably, this means that no matter where
                                    functions and variables are declared, they are moved to the top of their scope regardless of
                                    whether their scope is global or local.
                                    <pre>
                    <code>
                      greet("John"); // Hello John
                      function greet(name) {
                        var msg = "Hello ";
                        return msg + name; 
                      }
                    </code>
        </pre>
                                    It is possible to call he function greet above it's function definition
                                    because when we excute our code the javascript interpreter will scan all the code for
                                    function declaratins and for each a property is defined in the variable object and set to
                                    the funtion declaration. It is called function hoisting and it's possible only for function
                                    declation not function exprescion because function expression a just expression.

                    <p>In javaScript Scope determine where a certain varibale or function can be seen and In JavaScript
                        functions are used to create scope that means that any varibale define in the function will only be
                        accessible inside that function.Syntax
                        <pre>
                <code>
                  var name = "john"; // Global scope
                  function sayHi() {
                    var name = "John";
                    console.log(name); // John;
                  }
                  
                  console.log(name); // john

                        This example show that we show us to things first the we are using the same name for the two variable
                        and this possible because we used function and since functions create scope in JavaScript the name
                        varible inside the function sayHi will shadow the outer varibale name and we can see that in the
                        function the name varible is local to the function sayHi and it's value is John with uppercase J and
                        outside of the function the name varibale is john with lowecase j. second thing is that we can access
                        the name varibale defined in the function scope. another example
                        <pre><code>
                  function foo() {
                    var name = "foo is awesome function";
                    console.log(name); // foo is awesome function
                  }
                  
                  console.log(name); // ReferrenceError:  name is not defined

                    <p>An Execution is a box or a container in which a piece code is store and get evaluated. Important to note
                        that in JavaScript our code get always executed in an execution context and default exexution context in
                        the browser is the window object that's why all the varibales and functions defined in the global scope
                        are just properties window Object and functions
                        are just method of the window Object. Example
                        <pre>
              <code>
                var name = "John";

                What is “this” keyword in JavaScript. this keyword refers to an object, that object which is executing the current bit
                of javascript code. In other words, every javascript function while executing has a reference to its current execution
                context, called this. Example

                <pre>
                    <code>
                        function myFunction() {
                           return "My name is " + this.name + " and I'm " + this.age + " old";
                        }

                        var obj = {name: "John", age: 24};

                        var bound = myFunction.bind(obj);

                        bound(); // My name is john and I'm 24 old
                    </code>
